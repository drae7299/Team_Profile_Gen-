//Consts
const inquirer = require('inquirer');
const fs = require('fs');
const generateHTML = require()
// require all object (classes employee..)
//requirer
//fs
//team memebers open empty array( stores manager, employee oopbjects)
//generate or getemployee const for function** Makes actual template(reads the array and filters it and filters it into the proper array and then for loop)



//Logic
// create teams times 4x
//function to create our manager with inquirer package and ask questions from readme
//attach .then to handle responses(inside .then pass responses as arguments to class objects)(console.log)
//Save data to empy global array(push new object into new array in global)
//function to writeFileSync
//generateEmployee and pass in team members array from global consts





//.filter method returns array for managers(with this, call function that makes a template for each class objects)
//store mini templates into large array
//.join ("") makes mini temp into one biggggg template
//return temp vis writeFile and this writes to team html file
//.html (use as an argument)

// Test arguments
